When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I want to collaborate or share with others, so they can have access via the remote repository;
	Or when I am working with different machines myself, and want access to the repository from each machine;
	Or simply to have a fully up-to-date backup copy available online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Automatically-pulled changes might break some of the code you are still working on -- it could be very confusing to work on interdependent files that are changing as you edit them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are clones made on GitHub (or other repository-sharing system) which inform the creator that their respository has been forked and can set up for easy public or private sharing.
	Clones are copies of a repository made from a local or remote source repository.
	Branches are one more commits made from a source commit but developed separately from the source branch commit.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	It enables you to keep track of changes between the local and remote repositories (at least as of the last time the remote was pulled to the local store), even when offline.
