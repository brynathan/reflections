When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I want to collaborate or share with others, so they can have access via the remote repository;
	Or when I am working with different machines myself, and want access to the repository from each machine;
	Or simply to have a fully up-to-date backup copy available online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Automatically-pulled changes might break some of the code you are still working on -- it could be very confusing to work on interdependent files that are changing as you edit them.
